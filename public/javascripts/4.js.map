There is no\r\nseparate position solver.\r\n\r\nPseudo Velocities - After the velocity solver and position integration,\r\nthe position error, Jacobian, and effective mass are recomputed. Then\r\nthe velocity constraints are solved with pseudo velocities and a fraction\r\nof the position error is added to the pseudo velocity error. The pseudo\r\nvelocities are initialized to zero and there is no warm-starting. After\r\nthe position solver, the pseudo velocities are added to the positions.\r\nThis is also called the First Order World method or the Position LCP method.\r\n\r\nModified Nonlinear Gauss-Seidel (NGS) - Like Pseudo Velocities except the\r\nposition error is re-computed for each constraint and the positions are updated\r\nafter the constraint is solved. The radius vectors (aka Jacobians) are\r\nre-computed too (otherwise the algorithm has horrible instability). The pseudo\r\nvelocity states are not needed because they are effectively zero at the beginning\r\nof each iteration. Since we have the current position error, we allow the\r\niterations to terminate early if the error becomes smaller than b2_linearSlop.\r\n\r\nFull NGS or just NGS - Like Modified NGS except the effective mass are re-computed\r\neach time a constraint is solved.\r\n\r\nHere are the results:\r\nBaumgarte - this is the cheapest algorithm but it has some stability problems,\r\nespecially with the bridge. The chain links separate easily close to the root\r\nand they jitter as they struggle to pull together. This is one of the most common\r\nmethods in the field. The big drawback is that the position correction artificially\r\naffects the momentum, thus leading to instabilities and false bounce. I used a\r\nbias factor of 0.2. A larger bias factor makes the bridge less stable, a smaller\r\nfactor makes joints and contacts more spongy.\r\n\r\nPseudo Velocities - the is more stable than the Baumgarte method. The bridge is\r\nstable. However, joints still separate with large angular velocities. Drag the\r\nsimple pendulum in a circle quickly and the joint will separate. The chain separates\r\neasily and does not recover. I used a bias factor of 0.2. A larger value lead to\r\nthe bridge collapsing when a heavy cube drops on it.\r\n\r\nModified NGS - this algorithm is better in some ways than Baumgarte and Pseudo\r\nVelocities, but in other ways it is worse. The bridge and chain are much more\r\nstable, but the simple pendulum goes unstable at high angular velocities.\r\n\r\nFull NGS - stable in all tests. The joints display good stiffness. The bridge\r\nstill sags, but this is better than infinite forces.\r\n\r\nRecommendations\r\nPseudo Velocities are not really worthwhile because the bridge and chain cannot\r\nrecover from joint separation. In other cases the benefit over Baumgarte is small.\r\n\r\nModified NGS is not a robust method for the revolute joint due to the violent\r\ninstability seen in the simple pendulum. Perhaps it is viable with other constraint\r\ntypes, especially scalar constraints where the effective mass is a scalar.\r\n\r\nThis leaves Baumgarte and Full NGS. Baumgarte has small, but manageable instabilities\r\nand is very fast. I don't think we can escape Baumgarte, especially in highly\r\ndemanding cases where high constraint fidelity is not needed.\r\n\r\nFull NGS is robust and easy on the eyes. I recommend this as an option for\r\nhigher fidelity simulation and certainly for suspension bridges and long chains.\r\nFull NGS might be a good choice for ragdolls, especially motorized ragdolls where\r\njoint separation can be problematic. The number of NGS iterations can be reduced\r\nfor better performance without harming robustness much.\r\n\r\nEach joint in a can be handled differently in the position solver. So I recommend\r\na system where the user can select the algorithm on a per joint basis. I would\r\nprobably default to the slower Full NGS and let the user select the faster\r\nBaumgarte method in performance critical scenarios.\r\n*/\r\n/*\r\nCache Performance\r\n\r\nThe Box2D solvers are dominated by cache misses. Data structures are designed\r\nto increase the number of cache hits. Much of misses are due to random access\r\nto body data. The constraint structures are iterated over linearly, which leads\r\nto few cache misses.\r\n\r\nThe bodies are not accessed during iteration. Instead read only data, such as\r\nthe mass values are stored with the constraints. The mutable data are the constraint\r\nimpulses and the bodies velocities/positions. The impulses are held inside the\r\nconstraint structures. The body velocities/positions are held in compact, temporary\r\narrays to increase the number of cache hits. Linear and angular velocity are\r\nstored in a single array since multiple arrays lead to multiple misses.\r\n*/\r\n/*\r\n2D Rotation\r\n\r\nR = [cos(theta) -sin(theta)]\r\n    [sin(theta) cos(theta) ]\r\n\r\nthetaDot = omega\r\n\r\nLet q1 = cos(theta), q2 = sin(theta).\r\nR = [q1 -q2]\r\n    [q2  q1]\r\n\r\nq1Dot = -thetaDot * q2\r\nq2Dot = thetaDot * q1\r\n\r\nq1_new = q1_old - dt * w * q2\r\nq2_new = q2_old + dt * w * q1\r\nthen normalize.\r\n\r\nThis might be faster than computing sin+cos.\r\nHowever, we can compute sin+cos of the same angle fast.\r\n*/\r\nexport class b2Island {\r\n    constructor() {\r\n        this.m_allocator = null;\r\n        this.m_bodies = [ /*1024*/]; // TODO: b2Settings\r\n        this.m_contacts = [ /*1024*/]; // TODO: b2Settings\r\n        this.m_joints = [ /*1024*/]; // TODO: b2Settings\r\n        this.m_positions = b2Position.MakeArray(1024); // TODO: b2Settings\r\n        this.m_velocities = b2Velocity.MakeArray(1024); // TODO: b2Settings\r\n        this.m_bodyCount = 0;\r\n        this.m_jointCount = 0;\r\n        this.m_contactCount = 0;\r\n        this.m_bodyCapacity = 0;\r\n        this.m_contactCapacity = 0;\r\n        this.m_jointCapacity = 0;\r\n    }\r\n    Initialize(bodyCapacity, contactCapacity, jointCapacity, allocator, listener) {\r\n        this.m_bodyCapacity = bodyCapacity;\r\n        this.m_contactCapacity = contactCapacity;\r\n        this.m_jointCapacity = jointCapacity;\r\n        this.m_bodyCount = 0;\r\n        this.m_contactCount = 0;\r\n        this.m_jointCount = 0;\r\n        this.m_allocator = allocator;\r\n        this.m_listener = listener;\r\n        // TODO:\r\n        // while (this.m_bodies.length < bodyCapacity) {\r\n        //   this.m_bodies[this.m_bodies.length] = null;\r\n        // }\r\n        // TODO:\r\n        // while (this.m_contacts.length < contactCapacity) {\r\n        //   this.m_contacts[this.m_contacts.length] = null;\r\n        // }\r\n        // TODO:\r\n        // while (this.m_joints.length < jointCapacity) {\r\n        //   this.m_joints[this.m_joints.length] = null;\r\n        // }\r\n        // TODO:\r\n        if (this.m_positions.length < bodyCapacity) {\r\n            const new_length = b2Max(this.m_positions.length * 2, bodyCapacity);\r\n            while (this.m_positions.length < new_length) {\r\n                this.m_positions[this.m_positions.length] = new b2Position();\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        // TODO:\r\n        if (this.m_velocities.length < bodyCapacity) {\r\n            const new_length = b2Max(this.m_velocities.length * 2, bodyCapacity);\r\n            while (this.m_velocities.length < new_length) {\r\n                this.m_velocities[this.m_velocities.length] = new b2Velocity();\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    Clear() {\r\n        this.m_bodyCount = 0;\r\n        this.m_contactCount = 0;\r\n        this.m_jointCount = 0;\r\n    }\r\n    AddBody(body) {\r\n        // DEBUG: b2Assert(this.m_bodyCount < this.m_bodyCapacity);\r\n        body.m_islandIndex = this.m_bodyCount;\r\n        this.m_bodies[this.m_bodyCount++] = body;\r\n    }\r\n    AddContact(contact) {\r\n        // DEBUG: b2Assert(this.m_contactCount < this.m_contactCapacity);\r\n        this.m_contacts[this.m_contactCount++] = contact;\r\n    }\r\n    AddJoint(joint) {\r\n        // DEBUG: b2Assert(this.m_jointCount < this.m_jointCapacity);\r\n        this.m_joints[this.m_jointCount++] = joint;\r\n    }\r\n    Solve(profile, step, gravity, allowSleep) {\r\n        const timer = b2Island.s_timer.Reset();\r\n        const h = step.dt;\r\n        // Integrate velocities and apply damping.
